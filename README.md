# SFLU epitope diversity

As suggested by the reviewer, we try to study the diversity of mutations of the NP epitope in different samples. Both at nucletoide/locus level and at haplotype level.

Using two main metrics:
	1. Shannon entropy
	2. nucleotide diversity

For estimating the epitope diversity at halotype level, we have specifically developed a tool [epitope_diversity](https://github.com/Koohoko/epitope_diversity) for this purpose.
